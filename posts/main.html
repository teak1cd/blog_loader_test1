                            In the blog posts i put here on this site aim at exploring what is posible without taking years to set up a system with encoding and decoding messages.

                            <hr>I am a teenager with a passion for computers and making games. one issue I have is how do I make it difficult to modify levels or player saves. This all started when i was making a top down dungeon crawler and i needed to save
                            a couple sets of information about the player. What i would have done originally was just "level = 0" inside of an ini file. later on i moved my system over to encoding the entire file with base64. my latest system is encodeing
                            everything in base64 and not labeling the variables to make the process of guess and check much longer.
