this is a game i made that is simular to mini metro. i made this over the course of 24 hourse in one sitting.<br/>the final version of the game includes a population system, working stations and tranes, score, and reputation. this is an example of a game that is run through a single file. This is not an example of good code. Mouse checking is a few pixels off so if a button is not working try moving the mouse up a little bit.
