    <span style="font-size:20px;">I have been working on this project for a little while now, There are several issues including the rotating camera based on mouse movement. There is a WIP editor that can be found <a href="https://github.com/teak1cd/P5WEBGL-EDIT">here</a> that does not function currently. my goal is to implement box colission and a first person camera along with basic physcs and object manipulation. i am fairly happy with the save format even though there is a lot to be desired with it. one thing i would like to improve is the obect input format. The editor while just started does not render properly
