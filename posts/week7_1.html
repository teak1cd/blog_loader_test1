<h2>Encode the world week#7</h2>
                            In this day of technology we have so many different ways to hide things inside of computers. My goal is to explore what is possible and if you the reader are up to it break a code I provide each week. How this will work is there will be 3 hidden sections
                            that you can reveal the third one is this weeks code and the first and second are hints, some weeks there may only be one hint.
